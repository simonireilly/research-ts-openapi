## About

This repo uses the schema [](./schema.json), which is an Open API specification, to explore many ways in whcih typescript and OpenAPI specifications can interact.

- [ ] New projects, where a OpenAPI specificaion first approach can be used.
- [ ] Existing typescript projects, where retro fitting an Open API specification is needed.
